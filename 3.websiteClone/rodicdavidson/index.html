            <div>
              Conservation Areas were established 50 years ago in 1967 by the
              Civic Amenities Act and the Bloomsbury Conservation Area Advisory
              Committee (BCAAC), held an event to celebrate their important
              contribution to the preservation and enhancement of our built
              environment. Hosted by Hugh Cullum Architects, the Conservation
              Advisory Committee was addressed by Frank Dobson, the long-serving
              MP for Holborn and St Pancras (1979 to 2015). Frank Dobson has
              lived in Bloomsbury for many years and has supported BCAAC
              throughout by actively championing the cause of conservation in
              the local area. The Bloomsbury Conservation Area is large:
              approximately 160 hectares and is bounded by Euston Road to the
              north and High Holborn and Lincoln's Inn Fields to the south and
              from Tottenham Court Road in the west to King's Cross Road in the
              east. The Bloomsbury Conservation Area was one of the first to be
              designated after Conservation Areas were established in 1967.…
